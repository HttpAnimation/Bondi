# MacOS / Hackintosh info
# [Back](../README.md)

Due to [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) and [Hackintosh's](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) using well [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) as I don't own a [Mac](https://www.apple.com/mac/) I can't fully test stuff to make sure it fully works tho I used to own a [Hackintosh](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) but that pc sadly broke so am no longer able to test stuff out. Now as [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) is based of Unix I do know that commands and the main parts of [Bondi](https://github.com/HttpAnimation/Bondi) will work but other parts of [Bondi](https://github.com/HttpAnimation/Bondi) might not work such as UI , Maximum window size, Minimum window size will not work with [Bondi](https://github.com/HttpAnimation/Bondi) now if I ever get a [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) vm set up and running at full speed or a real [Mac](https://www.apple.com/mac/)/[Hackintosh](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) anymore I will be able to make sure this fully works.
