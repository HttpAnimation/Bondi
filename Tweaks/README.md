# Tweaks
Tweaks are extra software made for Bondi that can auto get data and make stuff for them or they can just make Bondi better.

## Flatpak generator
The **Flatpak generator** will run **flatpak list** in the terminal and then use that data to auto make data for a **Games.ini** and **subsections.ini** now these should not repalce you're files just be a addon to them

## Steam generator
This **Steam generator** is still being worked on and might not be done for a while beacuse I have no idea how this is really gonna work.
