# Stean generator
The **Steam generator** will grab a list of all steam game's installed in a directory that is given to it then it will make a **output/Games.ini** that can be used **Games.ini** and **subsections.ini** now note these should not repalce you're files just be a addon to them.

## Installing
Open a terminal and run the command listed under.
```
mkdir Steam\ generator && cd Steam\ generator && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HttpAnimation/Bondi/main/Tweaks/Steam%20generator/Steamgen.sh && mkdir output && cd output && touch Games.ini && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HttpAnimation/Bondi/main/Tweaks/Steam%20generator/output/subsections.ini && cd ../
```

## Running
In the same place where you installed the Steam generator tweak run the command to run
```
bash Steamgen.sh
```

## Other info
1) The file **TestingPath.ini** will not be needed as the file was only used for testing and I did want to enter the path every single dame time
2) Run the script with **-KS** to keep the source file
