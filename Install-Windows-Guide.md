# Install-Windows-Guide
All official [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us) support has been removed as V8 a block is installed into the app.

## Why?
Sorry [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us) mates, but due to [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us) being a listed as untrusted in my book I have removed all official support and help for [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us) now V7 and under can work but will not get any official support or updates you can use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) witch is like [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) for [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) but the other way around and way more buggy now this is not tested and might not work.

## Future
The future of [Bondi](https://github.com/HttpAnimation/Bondi) will stay fully working with [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) and [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) as they are both based of Unix.
