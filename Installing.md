To install bondi open a terminal on either [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) or [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) might work but it will never be tested on and no help will be provided with it.
    
    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HttpAnimation/Bondi/stable/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && bash install.sh
